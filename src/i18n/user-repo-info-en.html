  The aim of this space is to facilitate teachers the publication of their own JClic projects that are not available in
  the <a href="https://projectes.xtec.cat/clic/en/repo/">main library of the clicZone</a>.
</p>

  This service is currently available to users of the Educational Telematic Network of Catalonia (XTEC). If you do not
  have an XTEC identifier and wish to use the service, send us a message at: clic@xtec.cat.

  To publish a project, it must first be exported to the HTML5-SCORM format using an updated version of
  <a href="https://projectes.xtec.cat/clic/en/download/">JClic Author</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The projects published in this space can be used as evaluable activities in Moodle, embedded in a blog or website, and
  also spread to social networks.
